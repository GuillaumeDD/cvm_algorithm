# Implementation of the CVM Algorithm to Estimate the Number of Distinct Elements in a Data Stream

## Overview
This project implements the CVM algorithm to estimate the number of distinct elements in a data stream. 
The algorithm is particularly useful for memory-constrained scenarios where the exact count is not necessary, 
but an approximate count within a certain error bound is sufficient. 

This implementation includes visualizations to compare the estimated counts with the theoretical counts and 
to analyze the relative error.
